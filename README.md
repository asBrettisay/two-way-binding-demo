# Two Way Data Binding Demo

This is a short demo to demonstrate how two way data binding works in Angular involving a directive.

It also demonstrates a warning to developers with two way data binding

In this example, we are changing the value inside of the directive as well as outside the directive. This could be changing
more than we intend to and is a bad side effect.
